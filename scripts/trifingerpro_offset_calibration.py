"""Home Offset Calibration for TriFingerPro.

To calibrate the home offset values of a TriFingerPro robot, run this script
and wait until the robot is initialized.  Then move all joints back to the
end-stops to which they moved during initialization.  Make sure each joint is
touching the end-stop bumper but not pushing against it with force.  Then press
enter to determine the home offset.  The home offset values that are printed
can directly be copied to the configuration file of the robot.
